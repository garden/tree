ABOUT ME
========

I am a programmer and a language hacker.
I have quite a bit of insight in the current developments of the web platform.

I build this place. I make its front-end and its back-end match magnificently.

I like good reads, thoughtful demonstrations, hard-rock evidence, cosy places
and apple juice.

I can be contacted on Twitter @espadrine, on Google+ at +Thaddee Tyl, on
Facebook as a real-life friend.

By the way, you cannot read me like a book.
