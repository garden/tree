  "readme": "`node-irc`_ is an IRC client library written in JavaScript_ for Node_.\n\n.. _`node-irc`: http://node-irc.readthedocs.org/\n.. _JavaScript: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\n.. _Node: http://nodejs.org/\n\nYou can access more detailed documentation for this module at `Read the Docs`_\n\n\nInstallation\n-------------\n\nThe easiest way to get it is via npm_::\n\n    npm install irc\n\nIf you want to run the latest version (i.e. later than the version available via\nnpm_) you can clone this repo, then use npm_ to link-install it::\n\n    npm link /path/to/your/clone\n\nOf course, you can just clone this, and manually point at the library itself,\nbut I really recommend using npm_!\n\nBasic Usage\n-------------\n\nThis library provides basic IRC client functionality. In the simplest case you\ncan connect to an IRC server like so::\n\n    var irc = require('irc');\n    var client = new irc.Client('irc.dollyfish.net.nz', 'myNick', {\n\tchannels: ['#blah'],\n    });\n\nOf course it's not much use once it's connected if that's all you have!\n\nThe client emits a large number of events that correlate to things you'd\nnormally see in your favourite IRC client. Most likely the first one you'll want\nto use is::\n\n    client.addListener('message', function (from, to, message) {\n\tconsole.log(from + ' => ' + to + ': ' + message);\n    });\n\nor if you're only interested in messages to the bot itself::\n\n    client.addListener('pm', function (from, message) {\n\tconsole.log(from + ' => ME: ' + message);\n    });\n\nor to a particular channel::\n\n    client.addListener('message#yourchannel', function (from, message) {\n\tconsole.log(from + ' => #yourchannel: ' + message);\n    });\n\nAt the moment there are functions for joining::\n\n    client.join('#yourchannel yourpass');\n\nparting::\n\n    client.part('#yourchannel');\n\ntalking::\n\n    client.say('#yourchannel', \"I'm a bot!\");\n    client.say('nonbeliever', \"SRSLY, I AM!\");\n\nand many others. Check out the API documentation for a complete reference.\n\nFor any commands that there aren't methods for you can use the send() method\nwhich sends raw messages to the server::\n\n    client.send('MODE', '#yourchannel', '+o', 'yournick');\n\nHelp! - it keeps crashing!\n---------------------------\n\nWhen the client receives errors from the IRC network, it emits an \"error\"\nevent. As stated in the `Node JS EventEmitter documentation`_ if you don't bind\nsomething to this error, it will cause a fatal stack trace.\n\nThe upshot of this is basically that if you bind an error handler to your\nclient, errors will be sent there instead of crashing your program.::\n\n    client.addListener('error', function(message) {\n        console.log('error: ', message);\n    });\n\n\nFurther Documentation\n-----------------------\n\nFurther documentation (including a complete API reference) are available in\nreStructuredText format in the docs/ folder of this project, or online at `Read the Docs`_.\n\nIf you find any issues with the documentation (or the module) please send a pull\nrequest or file an issue and I'll do my best to accommodate.\n\n.. _npm: http://github.com/isaacs/npm\n.. _here: http://node-irc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/API.html\n.. _`Read the Docs`: http://readthedocs.org/docs/node-irc/en/latest/\n.. _`Node JS EventEmitter documentation`: http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter\n",
