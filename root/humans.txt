▻ “The File Tree” is a means to edit files on the web, share them, and organize
  your projects collaboratively.

▻ You can start using it by browsing to <http://thefiletree.com>, and creating a
  folder in the tree.

▻ All code written for this project is open source. You can join in if you have
  skills in art, programming, or writing. Ask me!

                     ✍ The Pencil ✍

The Pencil is the default text editor plug. It leverages the power of
CodeMirror, the open source web-based text editor for the masses. It isn't a
word processor, which means you can't replace Microsoft Word with it, but
hopefully another plug will come to fill that gap.

                     ✣ The Gateway ✣

The Gateway is the default browser plug. It lets you find your files really
quickly. This is the place where you can add files and folders, run programs,
edit your settings...

Be careful: if you switch from the Gateway to another plug, it might not have
the same power, and as a result, you might not be able to switch back!
